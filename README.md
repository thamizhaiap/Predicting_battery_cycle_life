Prediction of battery cycle life
Dataset is available at https://data.matr.io/1/projects/5c48dd2bc625d700019f3204

This work is based on the research article on Nature energy "Data-driven prediction of battery cycle life before capacity degradation" (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-019-0356-8#data-availability). 

I have developed a regression and classification model to predict the cycle life of battery and classify the batteries from their cycle life within 100 and 10 cycles respectively. 

Model-Cycle_less_than_100_Regression.ipynb : file contains the regression model to predict a battery cycle life within 100 cycles. 

Model-Cycle_less_than_20cycle_classification.ipynb: : notebook contains classification model to classify long and short life batteries with 20 cycles

Model-Cycle_less_than_10cycle_classification.ipynb : notebook contains classification model to classify long and short life batteries with 10 cycles

Model-Cycle_less_than_5cycle_classification.ipynb: : notebook contains classification model to classify long and short life batteries with 5 cycles
